## Version 0.2.1

Version 0.2.1 removes some of the css and replaces it with tailwind.
Also includes minor bugfixes.

## Version 0.2

Version 0.2 expands upon the base page adding some additional functionality to the website.

The project has been expaned to utilize routing.
Opening splash page, about me and product details pages added in.
Some CSS has been swapped out for tailwind, further migration to happen in the future. Some cleanup to the overall look has occured in the cart and various other places.
Ability to save and load cart to local storage has been added.
Configuration file has been added to allow consolidated customization outside the main files.

## Version 0.1

This project is a generic online store that utilizes react with a bit of tailwind.  
It will be designed with more configuration in mind in later versions, but you are currently working with an early rendition of this project.

## Roadmap

Eventualy this will be a full fledged online store with configurable backend. Currently it just displays items from a hard coded data set.

==================

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
